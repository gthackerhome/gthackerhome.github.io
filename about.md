# Welcome to GT Hacker Home!
### Tl;dr: This is a place for GT students to talk about interesting side projects 

## Target Audience:
We aim to help three groups of people:

* GT community members who want feedback on what side-projects they’re working on
* GT community members who want to see interesting side-projects other people are working on
* GT community members who want to find interesting side-projects to join


<!-- ## Joining:
There is a public invite tree
There are two ways to join:
Ask one of the current members for an invite (and provide verification you are a current/past GT student)
Explanation: We derived this from the Lobste.rs invite system. It allows for the community to grow organically while minimizing new spammers and providing some accountability for allowing spammers and malevolent actors (moderators will look up the invitation tree to consider disabling their inviter's ability to send invitations or, rarely, also banning). 
Submit a project you want to post to the mods, if accepted you’ll get an invite  -->

## Rules:

### In General:
* Be Kind
* No explicit language
* Eschew flamebait
* Limit political or ideological topics (discussing text editors is an exception)
* Don’t create sockpuppet accounts


### In Submissions:
* Submit projects that YOU are a part of 
* Projects can be at any stage (Initial idea, In-Progress, Completed)
* Tech-related blog posts are welcome too!
* Startup ideas may be submitted, but NO discussion of business models  or revenue streams. Focus on the merit of the idea (ie. how it helps people or how cool it is)
* No clickbait titles
* Don't delete and repost the same story. 
* Don’t spam links
* Don't solicit upvotes, comments, submissions, or invites
* Can be updates on past submissions (please add [UPDATE] to the title so we know :))

### In Comments
* Make substantive comments
* No Ad-hominem attacks
* If you think a comment is breaking our rules please downvote it (you will need to provide an explanation). 

## Features:
* Tags for different categories of ideas. These are predefined, but if you have an idea for more tags please ask the mods about it. We’ll put it up to a poll for the community and a simple majority will make it an official tag
* Hackathon/Off-topic threads: 1 weekly thread for off topic ideas and Hackathon threads (with hackathon tag) for discussion pertaining to specific hackathons
* RSS feeds per tag
